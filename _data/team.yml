  description: "was born in California, but he got to Texas as soon as he could. He studied Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin before entering the wild world of software development. After a brief stint at Cisco, he started his career at Famigo working on all aspects of web development. Then he swapped his Django experience for a chunky slice of Rails bacon and joined OrgSync in the fall of 2012. When he's not slinging code around, he likes riding bikes, playing Magic, and throwing frisbees."

  description: "is a polyglot developer originally from Colorado Springs, CO. He holds a masters degree in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Dallas, in OrgSync's own backyard. He joined OrgSync in April of 2012 after a three year foray into mobile app development. Cameron firmly believes that being a good developer implies being a good designerâ€”that developers must have an in-depth understanding of the way non-technical users think and interact with products and should design to align with user intuitions. In his free time he enjoys drinking tea, coding in Lisp, and studying Japanese."
