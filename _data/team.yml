He studied Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin before entering the wild world of software development. After a brief stint at Cisco, he started his career at Famigo working on all aspects of web development.

He joined OrgSync in April of 2012 after a three year foray into mobile app development.

In his free time he enjoys drinking tea, coding in Lisp, and studying Japanese."

  description: "Her design career began while she was a student at the University of Missouri, when the logo she submitted for the school's campus-wide philanthropy was selected as the winner and was featured on MTV when they broadcast from Mizzou during philanthropy week. Shortly after college and a rough Missouri winter, Valarie left St. Louis for the warmer climate of Dallas, where she worked as a freelance graphic designer for accounts including DFW Airport, La Madeleine, Mary Kay, Nokia, Pepsi, Pizza Hut and more. As the internet's popularity grew in the late 1990s, Valarie shifted her focus to web design, where her background in page layout and typography proved valuable to website design. She believes that user experience and content should drive design, and strives to build user interfaces that delight OrgSync's users. When she's not making the web a more beautiful place, Valarie likes to play golf, work in her garden, and admire her $0 electric bills, thanks to the solar panels she added to the roof of her house."
