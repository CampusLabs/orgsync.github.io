    <h2>Our Team</h2>
    <p>We are a small team of developers and designers commited to building a robust, performant and scalable web application that our users love. Most of our code is written in Ruby and runs on the Rails stack backed by a MySQL database, but we also incorporate other technologies such as Node.js, Memcached and Redis. We use GitHub for our version control and our infrastructure is entirely hosted via cloud services.</p>
