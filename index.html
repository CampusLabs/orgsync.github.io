      <p>
        <strong>We are a team of polyglots.</strong>
        Our platform runs primary on a Ruby on Rails app, but behind the scenes
        it is supported by services crafted in Clojure, Scala, and more,
        as well as off-the-shelf supporters such as Kafka, Redis, and
        Elasticsearch. On the front-end, we’re big React fans. We also
        have iOS and Android mobile apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Work hard. Ship Hard. Play Hard.</strong>
        We love what we do so we push ourselves
        but we also know how to have that work-life-balance (Well, most of us do).
        The most important thing is we all enjoy coming to work in the morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Learning.</strong>
        We like to use software that’s as close to the edge as possible while still
        being safe and production ready -- so we’re constantly learning new technologies and software.
        We do lunch and learns internally help share the knowledge and are constantly
        looking forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How we build.</strong>
        We are “sorta agile.” We’ve taken agile and modified the processes to fit
        our style. Daily standups help us get acquainted with each other’s projects
        and bi-weekly planning & retro get us all on the same track.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What we build with.</strong>
        We all have our own ways of doing things (VIM, Atom, Subl, RubyMine etc...)
        but it’s all connected via git and docker which makes replicating
        our environments almost easy.
        We’re an all-mac shop -- including a nice thunderbolt display that
        will be sitting on your desk.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Who decides what we build.</strong>
        Development at OrgSync isn’t like other companies – we have great say
        in what we do, balancing customer features and tackling technical debt
        (somehow we all acquire it, amiright?). Many of our biggest innovations
        were initiated from within our dev team.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Our office.</strong>
        We are looking for someone who wants to work with us in our headquarters
        in Dallas -- at this time we don't have any remote developers. Our office
        is relaxed and casual, the occasional dog runs around the office, and overall,
        it's a great place to spend your work day.
