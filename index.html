      <p>
        <strong>We are Polyglot.</strong>
        We write in Ruby, Javascript, Clojure, Scala, Objective C, Java
        and more... Our app runs on MySql, on s3, with a bunch of other
        services connecting to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Work hard. Ship Hard. Play Hard.</strong>
        We love what we do so we push ourselves
        but we also know how to have that work-life-balance (Well, most of us do).
        The most important thing is we all enjoy coming to work in the morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Learning.</strong>
        We like to use software that’s as close to the edge as possible while still
        being safe so we’re constantly learning new technologies and softwares.
        We do lunch and learns to help share the knowledge and are constantly
        looking forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How we build.</strong>
        We are “sorta agile.” We’ve taken agile and modified the processes to fit
        our style. Daily standups help us get aquained with eachother’s projects
        and bi-weekly planning & retro get us all on the same track.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What we build with.</strong>
        We all have our own ways of doing things but it’s all connected
        via git and docker. We’re an all-mac shop.
