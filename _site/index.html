      OrgSync started out as a small Rails application but now has to serve millions of users. So we are learning the best way to scale Rails, exploring other languages,
      implementing new features and plugging security issues. That's what we're here to talk about.

            ActiveInteraction is a gem for managing application specific business logic. Instead of living in controllers or models, business logic can find a home in interactions. They are designed to integrate seamlessly with Rails by behaving like ActiveModels. Use ActiveInteraction to shrink your controllers, slim your models, and DRY your code.

            A while back, I noticed our tests were slowing down for no apparent reason. It turns out our factories were creating a bunch of duplicate objects behind the scenes we didn't need.

            The validation that ships with Rails is useful, albeit generic. It leaves us to construct our own validators as dictated by our domains. The good news is that Rails gives us the tools necessary to build our own validators.

            More often than not, tests are treated as an afterthought or a second-class citizen. They are written to fulfill a requirement or to provide a mental safety net for the additions being made. After a while, the tests can become unmanageable. It may reach the point where updating them along with the business logic is such a daunting task that you stop writing tests altogether to meet deadlines.

            If you’ve taken up Ruby after learning another language like C++ or Java and you haven’t reexamined the meaning of “private” and “protected” then you’re almost certainly not using them the right way. Let’s spend a minute investigating their use in Ruby.

            The emails that our users at OrgSync receive from our app were getting stale, and no one wanted the task of reconfiguring them because of how much a pain it is to work with HTML emails. We have 27 individual views that generate emails, but those views get populated with content from all over our application--so this isn't the easiest of projects to begin with. Add in the list of things that suck about HTML emails and you get a decent-sized headache.

            The "Decorator Pattern" is used to extend the functionality of a single object without affecting any other instances of the same class. You can easily add functionality to an entire class via inheritance, but it is impossible to extend a single object using this approach. This pattern allows you to apply your extensions in either a static or dynamic fashion.

            The inaugural Big Ruby Conference kicked off on February 28 with almost the entire OrgSync development team in attendance. With a few exceptions, most Ruby conferences lack an overarching year-to-year theme. Big Ruby Conf is clearly for the enterprise audience. While this may conjure mental images of suits, marketeers spewing buzzwords and piles of red tape, Big Ruby Conf suffers from none of these ailments.

            When building complex web applications, you'll find there are business needs that require integrating with external services. In other cases, it may be more feasible to leverage a pre-existing service instead of reinventing the wheel.

            JRuby, a Ruby language implementation that runs on the JVM, allows developers to leverage the vast number of powerful libraries that have been written in Java while maintaining the simplicity and terse nature of the Ruby programming language. Since Java allows for method overloading and Ruby does not, at some point we may find ourselves needing to choose which overload we want to invoke. Thankfully, JRuby provides us with a couple of mechanisms.

            On Thursday, I ran into a puzzling issue at work. It first occurred three weeks ago and remained uninvestigated because it appeared to be a duplicate of another issue. When I deployed the fix for the other issue, I expected it to fix this one too. Turns out, it didn't.

            Last week the OrgSync development team was out en masse at Big Ruby Conf in our own backyard of Dallas, TX. We had a great time and listened to so many fantastic talks that it's hard to keep track of them all. To help with this problem I decided to put together a complete list of talks replete with links to slide decks. Enjoy!

            Right before last week's dallas.rb hack night, my coworker planted an idea in my head. He thought programming Hubot on the fly would be neat. I agreed with him; modifying Hubot from within the chat room simply by talking to him would be awesome. Since I spent last week hacking on Node.js, I figured I'd take a crack at it.
