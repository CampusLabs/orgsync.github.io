The OrgSync DevBlog
=======

Basically a standard jekyll setup.

### To Run Locally:

- clone repo
- bundle install
- jekyll serve --watch
- view at localhost:4000

### To Deploy:

Using standard github pages so just push to gh-pages branch

### To Write:

- Create a new file in _posts named with the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-title-dasherized

- Copy the FrontMatter from another post but the required fields are : title, author, comments (true or false), tags (currently available: activeinteraction, testing, rails, security, design, hack)

- Start at H3's in your markdown "###"
- use the tags {% highlight ruby %} and {% endhighlight %} to wrap your code blocks. (where ruby is your language of choice)
